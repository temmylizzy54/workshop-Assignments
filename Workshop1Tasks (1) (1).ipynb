    "\n",
    "The aim of this session is to introduce you to the concepts of programming by initially writing structured sequences of instructions. After that we will quickly get on with using Python, first with the Python Interpreter and then using the Jupyter Notebook environment, which we’ve briefly seen this week. This workshop will serve as an introduction to programming and Python, putting into practice all that we’ve covered this week. It is important to take time to understand these basic concepts, and explore what they can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind this workshop is about discovery, and experimentation surrounding topics covered so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to discuss the work with peers, or with any member of the teaching staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this Jupyter Notebook to develop and store your solutions to the exercises. Once you have completed this weeks tasks you should submit the workshop results to Canvas (not one at a time), but you can resubmit each weeks results as many times as you need to perfect any points that you may need to improve. You will get feedback from your teachers after each submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy material from this page into Canvas either by copying text from the screen or using the screen copy tool. On Microsoft Windows the \"Windows Snipping Tool\" can extract pieces of your screen. On an Apple Mac the <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> will copy an image of a section of the screen. Text can be copied on Microsoft Windows using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and pasted with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> (or by using the copy and paste menus on the mouse cursor). On an Apple Mac use the <kbd>⌘</kbd> instead of <kbd>ctrl</kbd>, but otherwise it works the same way."

This is achieved by stepping through the entire list, comparing the current element to the next in the sequence. If the current element is greater than the following one, they are swapped in-place. The loop then continues until all elements are exhausted. The effect of this is that the largest number will bubble up through the list to the top.
